Welcome to pyEulerCurves's documentation!
==========================================

**pyEulerCurves** is a Python library for parallel computation of Euler Characteristic Curves (ECC) from point cloud and bitmap data.

It provides fast and scalable methods for computing topological signatures useful in shape analysis, machine learning, and topological data analysis.

For theoretical background and applications, refer to the paper:  
*"Euler characteristic curves and profiles: a stable shape invariant for big data problems"*,  
`DOI: 10.1093/gigascience/giad094 <https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giad094>`_.
